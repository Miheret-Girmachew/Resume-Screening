# Resume-Screening<br>
# Machine Learning Project on Resume Screening using Python<br>
<h2>Introduction :-</h2><br>
<b>
  <ul>
  <li>Resume screening is the process of determining whether a candidate is qualified for a role based on his or her education, experience, and other information captured on their resume.</li>
  <li>It’s a form of pattern matching between a job’s requirements and the qualifications of a candidate based on their resume.</li>
  <li>The goal of screening resumes is to decide whether to move a candidate forward – usually onto an interview – or to reject them.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Functionality of Application</h2>
  <p>Screening resumes usually involves a three-step process based on the role’s minimum and preferred qualifications. Both types of qualifications should be related to on-the-job performance and are ideally captured in the job description.</p>
  <p>These qualifications can include:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Work experience</li>
  <li>Education</li>
  <li>Skills and knowledge</li>
  <li>Personality traits</li>
  <li>Competencies</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Tools & Technologies used</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Machine Learning and Artificial intelligence, along with text mining and natural language processing algorithms, can be applied for the development of programs (i.e. Applicant Tracking Systems) capable of screening objectively thousands of resumes in few minutes without bias to identify the best fit for a job opening based on thresholds, specific criteria or scores.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Tech innovations in resume screening</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Designed to meet the needs of recruiters that current technology can’t solve, a new class of recruiting technology called AI for recruitment has arrived.</li>
    <li>AI for recruiting is an emerging category of HR technology designed to reduce — or even remove — time-consuming, administrative activities like manually screening resumes.     </li>
    <li>The best AI software is designed to integrate seamlessly with your current recruiting stack so it doesn’t disrupt your workflow nor the candidate workflow.</li>
    <li>Industry experts predict this type of automation technology will transform the recruiting function.</li>
  </ul>
