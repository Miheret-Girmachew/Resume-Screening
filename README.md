# Resume-Screening<br>
# Machine Learning Project on Resume Screening using Python<br>
<h2>Introduction :-</h2><br>
<b>
  <li>Resume screening is the process of determining whether a candidate is qualified for a role based his or her education, experience, and other information captured on their resume.</li>
  <li>In a nutshell, it’s a form of pattern matching between a job’s requirements and the qualifications of a candidate based on their resume.</li>
  <li>The goal of screening resumes is to decide whether to move a candidate forward – usually onto an interview – or to reject them.</li>
  <h4>How it Works</h4>
  <p>Screening resumes usually involves a three-step process based on the role’s minimum and preferred qualifications. Both types of qualifications should be related to on-the-job performance and are ideally captured in the job description.</p>
  <li>Work experience<br>
Education<br>
Skills and knowledge<br>
Personality traits<br>
Competencies</li>
