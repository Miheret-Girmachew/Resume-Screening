# Resume-Screening<br>
# Machine Learning Project on Resume Screening using Python<br>
<h2>Introduction :-</h2><br>
<b>
  <ul>
  <li>Resume screening is the process of determining whether a candidate is qualified for a role based his or her education, experience, and other information captured on their resume.</li>
  <li>In a nutshell, it’s a form of pattern matching between a job’s requirements and the qualifications of a candidate based on their resume.</li>
  <li>The goal of screening resumes is to decide whether to move a candidate forward – usually onto an interview – or to reject them.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>How it Works</h4>
  <p>Screening resumes usually involves a three-step process based on the role’s minimum and preferred qualifications. Both types of qualifications should be related to on-the-job performance and are ideally captured in the job description.</p>
  <ul>
  <p>These qualifications can include:</p>
  <li>Work experience</li>
  <li>Education</li>
  <li>Skills and knowledge</li>
  <li>Personality traits</li>
  <li>Competencies</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Tech innovations in resume screening</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Designed to meet the needs of recruiters that current technology can’t solve, a new class of recruiting technology called AI for recruitment has arrived.</li>
    <li>AI for recruiting is an emerging category of HR technology designed to reduce — or even remove — time-consuming, administrative activities like manually screening resumes.     </li>
  </ul>
